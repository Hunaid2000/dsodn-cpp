<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Let's consider a scenario where the data is not located on a single machine but rather stored on multiple machines geo-distributed across the Internet. In such a scenario, searching or retrieval of data is very challenging, as it is hard to determine on which machine the required data is stored. This challenge can be solved by using a Data Structure that can efficiently search for data stored on a single machine. We will be mainly using <strong>Hash Tables</strong> along with <strong>Linked Lists</strong> to design an efficient solution for this scenario.
